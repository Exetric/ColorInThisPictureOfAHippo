# ColorInThisPictureOfAHippo

This is just a stupid website I made in like 2 days where you color in some pictures of hippos that me and my friends drew. If you want to run the website, you're gonna need to run it using an http server because the undo function uses a thing where it saves the canvas state in memeory, but for some fucking reason chrome only allows that function to work if you're running the site online or through something like a local host.
